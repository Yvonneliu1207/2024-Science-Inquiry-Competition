What is a Science Inquiry Competition?
A Science Inquiry Competition is typically a contest where participants engage in scientific research and present their findings. These competitions aim to encourage students to explore scientific questions, develop research skills, and apply scientific methods to solve problems. Here are some common features:
1. Participants: Usually open to students from middle school to high school, sometimes including university students.
2. Research Projects: Participants choose a scientific question or problem to investigate. They conduct experiments, gather data, and analyze results.
3. Presentation: Participants present their research through written reports, posters, and oral presentations.
4. Judging: Projects are judged based on creativity, scientific thought, thoroughness, skill, and clarity.
